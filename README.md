üëã Welcome! This demo app is designed to help you learn to build on Flow.

- Kitty Items: CryptoKitties Sample App is a **complete NFT marketplace** built with [Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence), Flow's resource-oriented smart contract programming language.
- Learn how to deploy contracts, mint NFTs, and integrate user wallets with the Flow Client Library (FCL).

## üé¨ Live Demo

Check out the [live demo of Kitty Items](http://kitty-items-flow-testnet-prod.herokuapp.com/),
deployed on the Flow Testnet.

If you'd like to deploy your own version, see the [deploy to Heroku](#optional-heroku-deployment) instructions near the bottom to this setup guide.

## ‚ú® Getting Started



### 1. Install Dependencies

_üõ† This project requires `NodeJS v14.x` or above._ See: [Node installation instructions](https://nodejs.org/en/) <br/>
_üõ† This project requires `flow-cli v0.28.0` or above._ See: [Flow CLI installation instructions](https://docs.onflow.org/flow-cli)

### 2. Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items.git
```
### 3. Install packages

- Run `npm install` in the root of the project.

## Local development

1)  Run `npm run dev:emulator` 
    - Local development uses the [Flow Emulator](https://docs.onflow.org/emulator/) and the [FCL Development Wallet](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-dev-wallet) to simulate the blockchain and an FCL-compatible wallet.

Thats it! üèÅ

## Testnet development

 Run `npm run dev:testnet` and follow the prompt to begin developing on testnet.

## Project Overview

![Project Overview](kitty-items-diagram.png)

## üîé Legend

Above is a basic diagram of the parts of this project contained in each folder, and how each part interacts with the others.

### 1. Web App (Static website) | [kitty-items/web](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/web)

A true dapp, client-only web app. This is a complete web application built with React that demonstrates how to build a static website that can be deployed to an environment like IPFS and connects directly to the Flow blockchain using `@onflow/fcl`. No servers required. `@onflow/fcl` handles authentication and authorization of [Flow accounts](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/accounts-and-keys/), [signing transactions](https://docs.onflow.org/concepts/transaction-signing/), and querying data using using Cadence scripts.

### 2. Look Ma, a Web Server! | [kitty-items/api](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/api)

We love decentralization, but servers are still very useful, and this one's no exception. The code in this project demonstrates how to connect to Flow using [Flow JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/onflow/flow-js-sdk) from a Node JS backend. It's also chalk-full of handy patterns you'll probably want to use for more complex and feature-rich blockchain applications, like storing and querying events using a SQL database (Postgres). The API demonstrates how to send transactions to the Flow blockchain, specifically for minting [Kitty Items](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/blob/master/cadence/contracts/KittyItems.cdc) (non-fungible tokens).

### 3. Cadence Code | [kitty-items/cadence](https://github.com/onflow/kitty-items/tree/master/cadence)

[Cadence](https://docs.onflow.org/cadence) smart contracts, scripts & transactions for your viewing pleasure. This folder contains all of the blockchain logic for the marketplace application. Here you will find examples of [fungible token](https://github.com/onflow/flow-ft) and [non-fungible token (NFT)](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft) smart contract implementations, as well as the scripts and transactions that interact with them. It also contains examples of how to _test_ your Cadence code.

## üò∫ What are Kitty Items?

Items are hats for your cats, but under the hood they're [non-fungible tokens (NFTs)](https://github.com/onflow/flow-nft) stored on the Flow blockchain.

Items can be purchased from the marketplace with fungible tokens.
In the future you'll be able to add them to [Ethereum CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/) with ownership validated by an oracle.
